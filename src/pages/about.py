        ## Background
        
        I'm an AI/ML Engineer with deep expertise in **transformer architectures**, 
        **large language models**, and **production ML systems**. My work spans from 
        implementing research papers from scratch to deploying scalable AI solutions 
        that serve real-world applications.
        
        ### Specializations
        - **Transformer Architectures** - Built from PyTorch fundamentals
        - **Large Language Models** - Fine-tuning, deployment, and evaluation
        - **MLOps & Production** - AWS serverless, containerization, IaC
        - **Research Applications** - Academic paper analysis, peer review prediction
        - **Applied NLP** - Psycholinguistic analysis, content generation
        
        ### Current Focus
        - Advancing transformer interpretability through attention visualization
        - Building production-ready LLM applications with robust evaluation frameworks
        - Developing AI tools for academic research and mental health assessment

    st.markdown("""
    I believe in **understanding AI systems from first principles**. Rather than just using 
    pre-built models, I implement architectures from scratch to truly understand their 
    mechanics. This deep understanding enables me to build more robust, interpretable, 
    and effective AI solutions.
    
    My projects bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and practical applications, 
    always with a focus on **transparency**, **reliability**, and **real-world impact**.
